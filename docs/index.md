Ubuntu Pro for WSL (UP4W) is a desktop application that facilitates access to [Ubuntu Pro]( https://ubuntu.com/pro) for [Ubuntu WSL](https://canonical-ubuntu-wsl.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/) instances.

It allows you to add your **Ubuntu** Pro subscription and your Landscape configuration to your Windows host. That will then automatically add your Ubuntu Pro subscription and Landscape configuration to all your Ubuntu WSL instances as well.

When you have a large Ubuntu WSL fleet, configuring every Ubuntu WSL instance manually can be a pain; with Ubuntu Pro for WSL it’s a breeze – regardless of the size of your fleet.

Ubuntu Pro for WSL is of value to system administrators, corporate security teams and desktop users.
