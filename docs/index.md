Ubuntu Pro For Windows
======================

Ubuntu Pro for Windows is a desktop application that provides compliance services for WSL instances.

It manages Ubuntu WSL instances, by pro-attaching them and establishing a connection with Landscape.

In a large organisation many repetitive steps are required to ensure compliance; Ubuntu Pro for Windows automates this work across an enterprise landscape.

Ubuntu Pro for Windows is of value to corporate security teams, system administrators and desktop users, all of whom would otherwise need to manage instances individually and manually.
