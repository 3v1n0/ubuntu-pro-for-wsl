# Ubuntu Pro (client)

The Ubuntu Pro client is a command-line utility (a CLI) that manages the different offerings of your Ubuntu Pro subscription. In UP4W, this executable is used within each of the managed WSL distros to enable [Ubuntu Pro](ref::ubuntu-pro) services within that distro.

This executable is provided as part of the `ubuntu-advantage-tools` package, which comes pre-installed in your Ubuntu WSL distros.

## Pro-attach
_Pro-attaching_ a machine (e.g. a desktop computer, a WSL distro, a server, a virtual machine, etc.) means to provide your [Ubuntu Pro token](ref::ubuntu-pro-token) to the Ubuntu Pro client, so that it can enable Ubuntu Pro services.
