# Ubuntu Pro client

The Ubuntu Pro client is a command-line utility (a CLI) that manages the
different offerings of your Ubuntu Pro subscription. In UP4W, this executable
is used within each of the managed WSL distros to enable [Ubuntu
Pro](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/pro/) services within that distro.

This executable is provided as part of the `ubuntu-advantage-tools` package,
which comes pre-installed in your Ubuntu WSL distros.

## Pro-attach
_Pro-attaching_ a machine (e.g. a desktop computer, a WSL distro, a server, a
virtual machine, etc.) means to provide your Ubuntu Pro token to the Ubuntu Pro
client, so that it can enable Ubuntu Pro services.

(ref::ubuntu-pro-token)=
## Pro token
An Ubuntu pro token is a secret string of numbers and letters that acts as
proof of purchase for your Ubuntu Pro subscription. Services provided by the
Ubuntu Pro subscription will require a token to run.

You can find out what your Ubuntu Pro token is by visiting your Ubuntu Pro
dashboard and logging in.
