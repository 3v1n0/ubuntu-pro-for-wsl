Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of the Windows OS that allows you
to run a Linux environment on your Windows machine, without the need for
manually setting up a separate virtual machine or dual booting. WSL is designed
to provide a seamless and productive experience for developers who want to use
both Windows and Linux at the same time.
